# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- conditional statements will be useful in an incredibly wide array of applications throughout coding. As we discussed in class, it can be used to validate whether a payment has been processed and follow up accordingly. It basically is a tool that can react to various inputs as opposed to having a more rigid structure.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? 
- For the last prompt in the comparisons file I realize I didn't need to create an if statement. One line of code would've sufficed!
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? 
 - What brought me the most satisfaction out of today's learning is seeing the building blocks coming together. While using the git workflow today it started to click into place and I realized that a semi-daunting process is going to become commonplace habit as time goes on. All the interfaces look less daunting over time as well as we start to figure out and utilize different tools and build familiarity. With conditionals, I can see a very wide range of application and it's exciting!
